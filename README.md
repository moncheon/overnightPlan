   ```

3. Run the interactive setup:
   ```bash
   ./setup-nights-watch.sh
   ```

### Daemon Usage

1. **Create your task file** (`task.md`):
   ```markdown
   # Daily Development Tasks

   1. Run linting on all source files
   2. Update dependencies to latest versions
   3. Run the test suite
   4. Generate coverage report
   5. Create a summary of changes
   ```

2. **Create safety rules** (`rules.md`):
   ```markdown
   # Safety Rules

   - Never delete files without backing up
   - Only work within the project directory
   - Always create feature branches for changes
   - Never commit sensitive information
   ```

3. **Start the daemon**:
   ```bash
   ./claude-nights-watch-manager.sh start
   ```

**Legacy Commands:**
```bash
./claude-nights-watch-manager.sh start [--at TIME]  # Start daemon
./claude-nights-watch-manager.sh stop              # Stop daemon
./claude-nights-watch-manager.sh status            # Check status
./claude-nights-watch-manager.sh logs [-f]         # View logs
./claude-nights-watch-manager.sh task              # View task/rules
./claude-nights-watch-manager.sh restart           # Restart daemon
```

## 📝 Configuration

### Task File (task.md)

The task file contains the instructions that Claude will execute. It should be clear, specific, and well-structured. See `examples/task.example.md` for a comprehensive example.

### Rules File (rules.md)

The rules file defines safety constraints and best practices. It's prepended to every task execution to ensure safe autonomous operation. See `examples/rules.example.md` for recommended rules.

### Environment Variables

- `CLAUDE_NIGHTS_WATCH_DIR`: Set the directory containing task.md and rules.md (default: current directory)

## 🎮 Commands

### 🔥 Plugin Commands (NEW!)

When using as a Claude Code plugin, use slash commands:

```bash
# Start the daemon
/nights-watch start

# Start with scheduled time
/nights-watch start --at "09:00"
/nights-watch start --at "2025-01-28 14:30"

# Stop the daemon
/nights-watch stop

# Check status
/nights-watch status

## 🧠 Plugin Features (NEW!)

### Task Executor Agent
Built-in AI agent that helps with:
- **Autonomous Task Planning**: Designing effective autonomous workflows
- **Safety Rule Creation**: Building comprehensive safety constraints
- **Daemon Management**: Starting, stopping, and troubleshooting
- **Log Analysis**: Interpreting execution results and identifying issues

**Usage:**
```
User: "Help me create an autonomous code review workflow"
Agent: Provides expert guidance and can execute /nights-watch commands

User: "My daemon isn't working, help debug"
Agent: Analyzes logs and suggests solutions
```

### MCP Server Integration
Provides 8 programmatic tools for Claude:
- `get_daemon_status` - Query daemon state
- `start_daemon` - Start with optional schedule
- `stop_daemon` - Stop the daemon
- `get_logs` - Retrieve log entries
- `read_task` - Read task.md content
- `read_rules` - Read rules.md content
- `write_task` - Update task.md
- `write_rules` - Update rules.md

### Smart Hooks
Automatic integration with Claude Code sessions:
- **SessionStart**: Shows daemon status when starting Claude Code
- **SessionEnd**: Prompts to start daemon if tasks are configured
- **PostToolUse**: Logs file modifications for audit trail

These hooks run silently in the background, enhancing your workflow.

## 🔧 How It Works

1. **Monitoring**: The daemon continuously monitors your Claude usage windows
2. **Timing**: When approaching the 5-hour limit (within 2 minutes), it prepares for execution
3. **Task Preparation**: Reads both `rules.md` and `task.md`, combining them into a single prompt
4. **Autonomous Execution**: Executes the task using `claude --dangerously-skip-permissions`
5. **Logging**: All activities are logged to `logs/claude-nights-watch-daemon.log`

### Timing Logic

- **With ccusage**: Gets accurate remaining time from the API
- **Without ccusage**: Falls back to timestamp-based checking
- **Adaptive intervals**:
  - \>30 minutes remaining: Check every 10 minutes
  - 5-30 minutes remaining: Check every 2 minutes
  - <5 minutes remaining: Check every 30 seconds

## ⚠️ Safety Considerations

**IMPORTANT**: This tool runs Claude with the `--dangerously-skip-permissions` flag, meaning it will execute tasks without asking for confirmation. 

### Best Practices:

1. **Always test tasks manually first** before setting up autonomous execution
2. **Use comprehensive rules.md** to prevent destructive actions
3. **Start with simple, safe tasks** and gradually increase complexity
4. **Monitor logs regularly** to ensure proper execution
5. **Keep backups** of important data
6. **Run in isolated environments** when possible

### Recommended Restrictions:

- Limit file system access to project directories
- Prohibit deletion commands
- Prevent system modifications
- Restrict network access
- Set resource limits
